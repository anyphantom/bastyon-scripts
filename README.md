## Script A1 - True Decentralization
Developers are such fools to block users right in the code, think about it...! There are also things like a list of verified users... Yeah, they're in the code too, lol. Either way, it's better for us. This script allows you to remove any blocked or verified users. Only 2 users are blocked at the moment, but let's not let them kill the idea of DeSo.
